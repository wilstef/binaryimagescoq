Formal specification and verification of binary image processing

This repository include formal specification and verification of binary image processing algorithms 
in Coq Proof Assistant. In addition, there is a prototype translator, written in C++, that translates 
real RGB images to Coq definitions, carries soundness proof of the translation process, and runs the verified operations over the image chosen.
